# Landing Page of the Udacity Front End Nanodegree  

## About this Project
In this project I had to build upon a static frame which was provided by udacity to build an interactive Landing Page. I decided to do this for a company which allows you to hire freelance robots.

The sections and Navigation bar are rendered with several dynamic elements which will always be different after a page reload.
